This is the GCloud's resource manager modules in Scala.

This is a sort of a map in the other repo https://github.com/raygit/resource_manager
and this repository will likely be a version later though
i like to be able to keep them synchronized.

Original modules were written in Java but i thought what the heck right?
We should have alternatives and if someone from the lab's sick of 
coding in Java, he/she should have the flexibility to be able to code
in some other language, in this case Scala. 

Scala's really done a good job in increasing productivity because 
i type less due to the relatively good type inferencer running and
checking the validity of the code and because of this, code is 
written tighter. More readable in a functional manner.

If you have seen the original version written in Java, the Scala
version will be relatively easier to follow since the approach i've 
taken is to at least map the file names so you don't have to go 
thru the centre of the Earth & back (whew).

Hope you had fun looking at it!
